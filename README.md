Overview

I participated in the PM School Hunch Case Study where the challenge was to improve Hunch, a social media app for GenZ that focuses on meaningful discussions through polls. My task was to identify and address user pain points while proposing new features that enhance engagement, gamification, and interactivity on the platform.
Proposed Features

    1. Poll Challenges and Contests
        Description: This feature allows users to create and participate in competitive polls, adding a gamified experience to Hunch. Users can challenge friends, join existing contests, and track their performance on leaderboards.
        Business Opportunity: Brands can sponsor these challenges, offering rewards to participants, which opens new monetization avenues for Hunch. Sponsorships provide a unique way for businesses to engage with users.
        Success Metrics: Participation rate, user retention, and growth in sponsored challenges.

    2. Save Polls
        Description: Users can now save polls they find interesting, allowing them to revisit and engage with them over time. This feature adds convenience and organization to the user experience.
        Business Opportunity: Data from saved polls can be used for market research and product development. Hunch can monetize this by selling analytics access to businesses.
        Success Metrics: Number of saved polls, engagement rates on saved polls, and adoption rate among new users.
    3. Video-Based Polls
        Description: This feature allows users to create polls using short video content, adding a rich, dynamic element to poll engagement. Video-based polls are more interactive and can boost participation rates.
        Business Opportunity: Sponsored video polls offer brands a unique platform for advertising and gathering user insights, opening up further revenue streams for Hunch.
        Success Metrics: Adoption rate of video-based polls, user interaction, and participation rates compared to text-based polls.

Prioritization

    Poll Challenges and Contests: Highest impact with a RICE Score of 62, offering strong potential for user engagement and brand sponsorships.
    Video-Based Polls: Scored 49, focusing on enhancing the user experience with more dynamic content.
    Save Polls: Scored 14, providing organizational tools for users and valuable data for Hunchâ€™s analytics.

Go-to-Market Strategy

    Pre-Launch:
        Conduct user research to gauge interest in gamified polls, video polls, and saved polls.
        Release teasers via social media and blog posts to create anticipation.
        Beta testing with active users and influencers to refine the features based on feedback.
    Post-Launch:
        Launch comprehensive marketing campaigns across social media, email, and in-app notifications.
        Partner with influencers to promote high-profile challenges and video-based polls.
        Continuously gather user feedback to optimize engagement and introduce new challenges regularly.

Result

Through this challenge, I gained valuable experience in product management, user engagement, and feature prioritization. I am proud to have developed a solution that enhances user interaction while also creating new business opportunities for Hunch.
